This branch is not a replacement of Bruno nor a fork. It's sync with Bruno main branch, but with feature/bugs fixes
that are not yet merged in the main branch.

I'll use this repo as a "testing" release that will contains feature that could are useful. They could be broken, ugly, but they should work at the end.

For each feature that I'll develop, I'll create a PR in Bruno repo. The goal is to have all my PR merged directly in Bruno, but until then, we can use them.

The PR are welcome too, but keep in mind that I'll not focus to fix issues that are in Bruno directly, so if you find a bug in Bruno always fill an issue there.

I hope this could be useful to someone else. Just follow this repo if you want to be notified for new release.
